## Slide 2

- Cross-cutting need for extracting data from APIs (as opposed to niche)

- APIs are evolving ([REST vs GraphQL](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-graphql-and-rest/))

- Multiple stakeholders involved (allow analysts to extract data from APIs?)

- Need to integrate with existing tech stack

- Alternatives are available e.g. [Meltano](https://meltano.com/)

- dltHub is very Recent ([2022](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt/graphs/contributors))

- Do we need to consider data extraction in general?
