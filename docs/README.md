# Problem Statement

### :warning: Problem
The Data Engineering tool stack is fragmented by domain

There is minimal cross-cutting oversight

We have little visibility on the health of our data pipelines

### :moneybag: Impact
Duplication of effort

Hinders mobility between domains

We spot problems too late

More fragmentation as teams resort to quick-fixes

### :compass: Context 
Generic solutions require cross-cutting technical and domain knowledge 

Generic solutions are more complex and take longer to build

### :bulb: Opportunity
Generic solutions are more sustainable in the long-term

Supporting domains to develop cross-cutting solutions, starting with monitoring, presents a strategic opportunity

# What is the Centre for Excellence?

##### Enables domain teams to evaluate, build, adopt and promote cross-cutting solutions.

- :sos: Need-driven: We prioritise addressng immediate challenges faced by domain teams and their partners

- :eyes: Innovative: We stay abreast of developments in data and analytics engineering and their potential for improving our tech stack

- :hourglass_flowing_sand: Rotational membership: We collaborate with domain team(s) for the duration of the project

- :busts_in_silhouette: Cross-cutting: We consult and advocate across domains and professions

- :handshake: Delivery through others: We provide technical oversight, coaching and share good practice. Upon completion, we hand over assets to domain or platform teams
