# Centre for Excellence

The Centre for Excellence sets the technical direction for Data and Analytics Engineering. See the [mission statement](https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/dmet-cfe/) for how we do this.

## Investigations

Summarises investigations into new technologies, tools and approaches. Slides are created using Markdown and [Marp](https://marp.app/).  

The `marp-to-pages` GitHub action copies any images in the respective `images` folder, converts the slides to HTML and publishes the slides to https://moj-analytical-services.github.io/dmet-cfe/<investigation_name>.
