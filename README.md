## Investigations

This directory summarises investigations into new technologies, tools and approaches. 

## Slides and [Marp](https://marp.app/)

- The slide decks in this repo are created using [Marp](https://marp.app/) (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem).
- Marp's format is based on [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), a consistent Markdown specification.
- For those familiar with [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/), it's a way of separating formatting from text, and means you can save documents as code.
- Marp comes with various in-built [themes](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-core/blob/main/themes/README.md).

- The slides use the custom [MoJ Marp theme](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/marp-moj-theme).
- The slides are published to GitHub pages using the `gh-deploy.yml`.
- See [GitHub as a one-stop-shop](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/data-and-analytics-engineering/blog/posts/github-as-a-one-stop-shop/#slides) for some general guidance on using Marp.
